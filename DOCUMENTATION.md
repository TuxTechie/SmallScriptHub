# Password Generator Documentation

## Overview
The Password Generator script allows users to generate secure passwords of varying lengths and complexities. The script is written in Bash and uses the `/dev/urandom` pseudo-random number generator to ensure strong and unpredictable passwords.

## Functions

### `generate_password()`
This function generates a password of a specified length using a combination of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, digits, and special characters.

**Parameters:**
- `length`: The desired length of the password.

**Usage:**
```sh
generate_password 16
```
## Script Flow
Display the menu with three options: Small Password (8 characters), Large Password (16 characters), and Complex Password (24 characters).

Read the user input and call the generate_password() function with the appropriate length based on the user's choice.

Print the generated password to the console.

## Error Handling
If the user enters an invalid option, the script will display a message indicating the invalid choice and prompt the user to try again.

## Enhancements
Future enhancements could include:

Allowing the user to specify custom lengths for passwords.

Adding additional complexity options (e.g., including or excluding certain character sets).

Integrating with a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user experience.
